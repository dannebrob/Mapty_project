# Mapty_project

## About
This was one of the more significant projects in the Complete Javascript course by Jonas Schmedtmann.
The app's purpose is to track workouts (running and cycling) and display them on the map.
Some of the key concepts: Object-Oriented Programing, Geolocation API, Third-party library and Local Storage.

It was a great project and I learned a lot, I can see myself using this app in my day-to-day workout, I hope you will find it as awesome as I!

## Install
